Diwali, celebrants will prepare by cleaning, renovating, and decorating their
homes and workplaces with diyas (oil lamps) and rangolis.[15] During Diwali,
people wear their finest clothes, illuminate the interior and exterior of their
homes with diyas and rangoli, perform worship ceremonies of Lakshmi, the goddess
of prosperity and wealth,[note 1] light fireworks, and partake in family feasts,
where mithai (sweets) and gifts are shared.
