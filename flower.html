<p align="justify" ><br><br><br><br>A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom,
is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The
biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with
eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) resulting from
cross pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower) when self pollination occurs.
