<p align="justify" ><br><br><br><br>In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem,
or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species.In wider definitions, the taller palms,
tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have
independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees tend to be long-lived,
some reaching several thousand years old. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years.</p>
